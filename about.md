## About this guide

This originally was written by [Andrew Andrade](http://mrandrewandrade.com) and [Professor Lukasz Golab](http://www.engineering.uwaterloo.ca/~lgolab/) as suplimental notes for [MSCI 723](http://www.ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/SA/GRAD/1516/GRDcourse-MSCI.html#MSCI723) a graduate course about [data science, data mining and big data](https://uwaterloo.ca/management-sciences/news/data-analytics-courses-available).  Since the students come from many different backgrounds (some non-technical) we strived to provide many optional background readings (both for beginners and advanced practitioners) which we think will be useful to becoming a better data scientist.

The goal is now to provide a comprehensive guide to data science starting with an approach for small to [medium data](http://svdictionary.com/words/medium-data), and later outline big data analysis. It is more managable to learn the techniques with smaller data sets which fit in memory first, and then move onto analysis of very large datasets which might require multiple computers.

## Why We created this guide

 Ever since Harvard Business Review claimed that being a [Data Scientist is the Sexiest Job of the 21st Century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/) there have been countless guides, blogs, courses, new sites and tutorials on different aspects of data science, machine learning, statistics and many many more related topics.  Different than other guides, this site strives to act as (somewhat comprehensive) learning plan or a road map with practical advice for getting started on a journey into the world of data science.

The notes provide a high level overview of topics and the tutorials provide hands on examples (and code)

While we attempt to be comprehensive, this guide is still a work in progress and we look foward to edits, improvements and suggetions.
