## Programming Fundamentals

### Basics

Arrays, loops, functions, reading/writing data, objects, vectors, lists, variables, expressions, factors

[Udacity's Intro to Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101) and [Programming Foundations with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036) are great resources to both learn programming and python.  You can view and learn the course material for free or you can take the course and get extra help.

# Data structures

Specifically focus on understanding graphs, trees (binary trees), hash functions,  algorithm complexity & big O notation

TODO: find good resource

# Algorithms

Searching and manupilating graphs and trees, sorting Algorithms, and searching algorithms.

TODO: find good free resource

## Numerical methods

Understand how rounding errors affect calculations.

## Next Steps

Once you think you have the required programming background, go can go back to the [required background](/required-background) and complete the rest of the modules.
